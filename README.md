[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/headmelted/vscode-multiarch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/headmelted/vscode-multiarch)

This repository hosts a fork of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) that has been modified 
to produce cross-compiled packages for ARM architectures.  These can be found under the [Releases]() section.

In addition, the **docs** directory contains a series of scripts to help users to install VS Code onto 
Chromebooks, by using Crouton to establish a **chroot** environment and display the window on Chrome OS.

Please let me know of any issues you find with these builds, but please first check to see if the issue 
has been reported on the main [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode) repository to ensure that
only ARM-specific and/or Chromebook-specific issues are raised here.

More information about these builds and how they work is available on [the dedicated website](https://code.headmelted.com).
