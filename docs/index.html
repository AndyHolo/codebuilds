<h1 id="platforms"><i class="fa fa-table"></i>&nbsp;Platforms</h1>
<p>The primary focus of this site is to provide builds of the open-source edition of VS Code for less common platforms (those that might not otherwise receive them).</p>
<dl>
  <dt><i class="fa fa-microchip"></i>&nbsp;Architectures</dt>
  <dd>i386, amd64, armhf, arm64</dd>
  <dt><i class="fa fa-archive"></i>&nbsp;Packages</dt>
  <dd>DEB, RPM, Snappy, Flatpak, AppImage</dd>
  <dt><i class="fa fa-cogs"></i>&nbsp;Operating Systems</dt>
  <dd>Android*, Chrome OS*, Linux <i>(* uses embedded Linux)</i></dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="testing"><i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i>&nbsp;Testing</h1>
<p>For each and every release, the build system prepares a virtual system for the given architecture. The finished package is then installed and tested with the full suite of tests from Microsoft. Once this is done, a test report is prepared that can be downloaded for review.  Only packages that pass all tests will proceed to release.</p>

<h2 id="linux-install-scripts"><i class="fa fa-linux"></i>&nbsp;Scripted Linux Installation</h2>
<i>(including Raspberry Pis, Odroids and other single-board computers)</i>

<p>Packages are currently available in DEB and RPM format for ARM, x86 and amd64 systems.</p>

<p>You can use the scripts here to install the packages and add their repository to your system.</p>

<p>Open a new terminal. If you need super-user rights (you probably do), then you can enter <strong>sudo -s</strong> and press return
to enter a super-user session. Run the installer for your current distribution:</p>

<h3 id="header-apt"><img src="images/debian-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;APT instructions</h3>
<i>(including Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint)</i>

<pre id="install-apt">. <( wget -O - https://codebuilds.org/installers/apt.sh )</pre>

<h3 id="header-yum"><img src="images/rpm-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;YUM instructions</h3>
<i>(including Fedora, Pidora, Red Hat and SUSE)</i>

<pre id="install-yum">. <( wget -O - https://codebuilds.org/installers/yum.sh )</pre>

<p>Press the return key.  Once the installer has completed, you should have a "Code" entry in your desktop program list.</p>

<h3 id="linux-header-manual"><i class="fa fa-linux"></i>&nbsp;Manual Linux installation</h1>

<p>If for any reason the script above will not work on your system, or you do not want to add the package source
for updates, you can get the latest version of the package for your system below.</p>

<h4 id="header-gpg"><img src="images/gpg-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;Public GPG key</h3>

<p>For either APT or YUM installation, you'll want the public GPG key to verify the package, which you can download <a href="https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=headmelted">here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="header-apt"><img src="images/debian-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;APT packages</h3>
<i>(including Debian, Raspbian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint)</i>

<p>These packages are now available directly from <a href="https://github.com/headmelted/codebuilds/releases">the releases page</a>.</p>

<h4 id="header-yum"><img src="images/rpm-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;YUM packages</h3>
<i>(including Fedora, Pidora, Red Hat and SUSE)</i>

<p>These packages are currently unavailable.  I'll try to get these back online as soon as possible.</p>

<h4 id="header-snap"><img src="images/rpm-logo.png" width="18" height="18">&nbsp;YUM packages</h3>
<i>(including Fedora, Pidora, Red Hat and SUSE)</i>

<p>These packages are currently unavailable.  I'll try to get these back online as soon as possible.</p>

<h1 id="faq"><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i>&nbsp;Frequently asked questions</h1>

<dl>
  
<dt>What is this?</dt>
<dd>These are automated builds of the open-source edition of Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.</dd>

<dt>How does this work?</dt>
<dd>The latest code is pulled on a nightly basis from Microsoft's <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode">official repository</a>. If there are updates, the code is built, tested, packaged and deployed.</dd>

<dt>Which devices are supported?</dt>
<dd>Please refer to the <a href="#platforms">Platforms</a> section.</dd>

<dt>Do these releases support extensions?</dt>
<dd>The extensions you want <strong>should</strong> work, so long as they do not depend on underlying tools that are not supported on your architecture.</dd>

<dt>Can I really run Visual Studio Code on my phone?</dt>
<dd>You may be able to run it, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a physical keyboard. The Android instructions are really intended for convertible tablets and docked handsets.</dd>

<dt>Do I need to "root" my Android device?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely not, and there are good security reasons not to.</dd>

<dt>Do I need to put my Chromebook into Developer Mode?</dt>
<dd>Absolutely not, and there are good security reasons not to.</dd>

<dt>Will Visual Studio Code run on my device?</dt>
<dd>The best way to find out if your device is compatible is to go to the <a href="#instructions">Instructions</a> section and try it for yourself.</dd>

<dt>Which virtual systems are these releases tested on?</dt>
<dd>
  <dl>
    <dt>32-bit ARM hard-float (armhf)</dt>
    <dd>These packages are tested on a Raspbian Jessie image to mimic a Raspberry Pi 2.</dd>
    <dt>64-bit ARM hard-float (arm64)</dt>
    <dd>These packages are tested on a modified Ubuntu 16.04 image to mimic a Odroid C2.</dd>
  </dl>
</dd>

<dt>Are these releases provided by Microsoft?</dt>
<dd><strong>No</strong>. These releases are an independent community effort. For clarity, this website (and the releases here) are <strong>not</strong> affiliated with Microsoft.</dd>

<dt>Why is the logo so much different from the one on Microsoft's website?</dt>
<dd>The Visual Studio Code logo is owned by Microsoft, and is reserved for use on releases provided directly by them.</dd>

<dt>Where are the packages being hosted?</dt>
<dd>The release packages are hosted by JFrog Bintray, who are graciously providing this service for free under their open-source plan.</dd>

<dt>This is really cool. Can I help with this?</dt>
<dd>Yes you can! Any and all help is appreciated, but you'll need to digitally sign the <a href="https://cla.microsoft.com/">Microsoft CLA</a> first, so that we can contribute any fixes back upstream to the core repository.</dd>

<dt>So who maintains this site?</dt>
<dd>I'm Jay. Nice to meet you. You can find my details in the <a href="#contact-me">contact section</a>.</dd>

<dt>Are you a Microsoft MVP?</dt>
<dd>I am not.</dd>
